# NMM---FortuneTeller
# (Coming Soon)

You will need the nltk library to run this program.
You can download it by running "pip install nltk" with whatever administrative permissions you need for your terminal. 


You will also need to download the "popular" subset of nltk data. 
You can do this by running "python -m nltk.downloader popular" in your terminal.


This should be the only module you need to download. 
Future, random, time, sys, datetime, and binascii should be included in a normal python installation.


When run, the program will ask for how many iterations you want, then how many words you want your fortune to be.
The iterations will then run and you will be able to observe the progress as well as the number of unique words and words greater than 3 letters. When the iterations are done, the program will display all the words generated and then generate the fortune.

In order to get a solid number of words and a good chance at at least one word that is longer than 3 letters, you need to run around 2000 iterations.
On my computer, this program ran at approximately 4.6 iterations per second.
