# NMM---FortuneTeller
(Coming Soon)

You will need the nltk library to run this program. 


You can download it by running "pip install nltk" with whatever administrative permissions you need for your terminal. 



You will also need to download the "popular" subset of nltk data. 


You can do this by running "python -m nltk.downloader popular" in your terminal.


This should be the only module you need to download. 


__future__, random, time, sys, datetime, and binascii should be included in a normal python installation.



In order to get a solid number of words and a good chance at at least one word that is longer than 3 letters, you need to run around 2000 iterations.


On my computer, this program ran at approximately 4.6 iterations per second.
